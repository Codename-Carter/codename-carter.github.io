          Hello there viewers! <br />
          My name is Tion Carter. Some people call me "T" for short.
          <i>(As if my name is long)</i> <br />
          I was born and raised here in Richmond, Virginiaâ€”originally in the
          heart of the city, before moving to the suburbs nearly a decade ago.
          <br />
          I attended Varina High School, where I graduated 3rd in class with a
          4.53 GPA. <br />
          I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia
          Commonwealth University (VCU) just before the commencement of the
          pandemic in December of 2019. <br />
